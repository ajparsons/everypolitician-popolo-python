0.0.11
    * The 'filter' method on collections now returns another
      collection.
    * Add a 'memberships' property to Event, primarily so that
      members of a legislative period can easily be found.
    * Add 'elections' and 'legislative_periods' properties to
      EventCollection to filter down the events to just
      elections or terms.
    * Add helper methods to the `Popolo` class to access
      elections, terms, the latest term, etc. directly.
    * Thanks to Andy Lulham for contributing these improvements
      in this version.
0.0.10
    * Fix the Person.twitter property when no Twitter details
      were found.
0.0.9
    * Fix __repr__ magic methods that broke on non-ASCII
      strings.
0.0.8
    * approx_dates is now a separate package on PyPi; this
      version switches to using that.
0.0.7
    * An exception is no longer raised if you call
      Person.twitter when there are multiple Twitter usernames
      found. The complete list can now be found with
      twitter_all. (Similar changes have been made for phone,
      fax and facebook.)
    * ApproxDate now has a proper repr() representation
      (i.e. the repr can be used to recreate the object)
0.0.6
    * Fix a bug where properties returning dates didn't
      consistently return ApproxDate objects.
    * Make all Popolo objects hashable, so you can use set() to
      remove duplicates, for example.
    * ApproxDate can now express dates arbitrarily far in the
      future or past.
    * Add methods to Membership and Event to make it easy to
      check if the object is current with respect to its
      start_date and end_date.
    * Make access to single related objects much more efficient.
0.0.5
    * Add basic support for partial dates (e.g. '1999-12'). All
      date properties now return ApproxDate objects.
0.0.4
    * The initial release: this is the first release with
      reasonable parity with the Ruby gem that this package is
      based on.
